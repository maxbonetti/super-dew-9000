## React Developer Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my React Developer Portfolio! As a bootcamp graduate, I'm excited to present this single-page application that showcases my skills and projects built with React. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **About Me**: A section where you can learn more about me, including a brief bio and a recent photo. I share my journey and passion for web development.
- **Portfolio**: This section features my projects, complete with titles, images, and links to both live demos and GitHub repositories. It highlights the diverse range of applications I've developed.
- **Contact**: A functional contact form that lets you get in touch with me directly. It includes fields for your name, email, and message, with validation to ensure proper input.
- **Resume**: Here you can download my resume and view a list of my technical proficiencies, giving you a clear picture of my skills and experience.

This portfolio is a testament to my ability to build responsive and dynamic web applications. It’s deployed on Netlify, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience. I hope you enjoy exploring my work, and I look forward to any opportunities for collaboration or feedback.
